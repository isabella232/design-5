# source{d} UI Pattern Library

## Ready to use UI Assets

Here you find the UI Pattern Library for web brand applications.

- [Main Sketch Pattern Library File](files/landing-pattern-library.sketch)
- [Typography Symbols Library File](files/typography.sketch)
- [UI Elements Symbols Library File](files/ui-elements.sketch)

> Note:  please download all files and keep them in one folder. The main landing-pattern-library.sktech file calls the other ones as libraries of symbols.

If you're looking for an alternative to Sketch, you can use the Pattern Library [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) export.
